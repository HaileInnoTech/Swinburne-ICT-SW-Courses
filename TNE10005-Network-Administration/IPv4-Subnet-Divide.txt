Parent network: 128.98.0.0/17

Network requirements:Â 
10 location => We would need at least 4 subnet bits. (2^4 = 16 > 10)
1200 devices => We would need at least 11 host bits.  ( 2^11 = 2048> 1200)

The internal/subnet mask is /21 it has 4 subnet bits and 11 host bits.  
=> Requirements met

Subnet gap = 256 - 248 = 8
